pyorbit-2.0.0:  1-September-2003
	- roll version number over to 2.0
	- get rid of some unused code in the method call marshaller.

pyorbit-1.99.7:  24-August-2003
	- fix a problem with handling of exceptions that was uncovered
	  by Python 2.3.
	- disable assigning to unknown attributes on stub instances.  Saves
	  a little memory too.
	- add CORBA.ORB.work_pending() and CORBA.ORB.perform_work() methods.

pyorbit-1.99.6:  31-July-2003
	- clean up base class list when building client stubs.  This
	  is needed in order for the stubs to work with Python 2.3.
	- fix some possible segfaults if the argument names are
	  missing in the IInterface structures, which occurs when
	  using ORBit.load_file().

pyorbit-1.99.5:  16-July-2003
	- Work with latest HEAD branch (ORBit2 2.7.x).
	- allow importing of CORBA or PortableServer without first
	  importing ORBit.  This gives better compatibility with
	  standard CORBA mapping.
	- None is not a valid string/wstring value.
	- accept strings for sequence<octet>.

pyorbit-1.99.4:  23-March-2003
	- support generation of stubs at runtime from IDL files using
	  the imodule service found in ORBit2 2.6.
	- fix marshalling of "long long" and "unsigned long long"
	  values.
	- fix compilation problem with ORBit2 HEAD branch (2.7.x).

pyorbit-1.99.3:  27-December-2002
	- upgrade to latest auto tools (autoconf-2.57, automake-1.7.2,
	  libtool-1.4.3).
	- add CORBA.TC_* constants.
	- remove messages printed when creating a stub module.

pyorbit-1.99.2:  16-November-2002
	- Require ORBit2 >= 2.4.4.
	- make sure servants start up in a valid state by moving
	  initialisation to tp_new rather than tp_init.
	- add support for ORBit-Python "delegate" style servants.
	- improve handling of unknown exceptions (they are usually
	  caused by errors in the program, so print a stack trace).
	- marshalling fixes (handle NULL strings, and sequences
	  embedded in complex types).
	- change semantics of pycorba_object_new() so that it
	  duplicates the object reference.
	- prevent subclassing of various types that shouldn't be
	  subclassed.
	- wrap enumeration values as int subclasses such that repr()
	  will return the string version of the enum.
	- beginning of fixed<d,s> wrapper.  Pretty useless at the
	  moment, since support in ORBit2 is broken.
	- add a spec file.

pyorbit-1.99.1:  30-October-2002
	- add PortableServer bindings (Servant and POA).
	- escape names that conflict with Python keywords.
	- move tests to tests/ subdirectory, and add a test server.
	- change union members _d and _v to slots.
	- install a pyorbit.h header that can be used by other Python
	  packages to interoperate with pyorbit.
	- put un-namespaced types in the _GlobalIDL module (like
	  omniORBpy does).
	- add some warnings to ORBit.load_typelib() to try and
	  identify broken typelibs.
	- add a test to demonstrate ability for in process C code to
	  invoke operations on Python objects and vice versa.

pyorbit-1.99.0:  20-October-2002
	- initial release.
	- basic support for most client side operations.
