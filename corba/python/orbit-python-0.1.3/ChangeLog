   * Ported the whole mess to C.  Aside from compiling 20% faster, it should
     hopefully build properly on more platforms.  I've also (through some 
     crude measurements) noticed a 5-10% speed increase.
   * idl.c, except.c, types.c: fixed unions, structs, and exceptions so that
     attributes set on construction are set for the instance object, not for
     the class object. 
   * Released 0.1.3

2000-03-16  Jon Kåre Hellan <hellan@acm.org>

   * idl.cc: pass IDL_parse_filename IDLF_CODEFRAGS which is required for
     Gnumeric.idl

   * CORBA_ORB.cc: CORBA_ORB_PyObject__new properly accepts either lists or
     tuples for parameter 1.
   * CORBA_ORB.cc: resolve_initial_references handles RootPOA properly now
   * CORBA_ORB.cc, CORBAmodule.cc: made ORB_init more conformant
   * exceptions raised by check_corba_ex() now work properly

   * CORBA_ORB.cc: implemented CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references
     (still need to handle RootPOA and POACurrent)
   * idl.cc, CORBAmodule.cc: load_idl() now takes optional preprocessor
     parameters to pass to IDL_parse_filename
   * demarshal.cc: can demarshal generic Objects now.
   * idl.cc, CORBAmodule.cc: now handles libIDL errors (such as missing file) 
     gracefully by raising an exception.

   * CORBAmodule.h, idl.cc, marshal.cc, demarshal.cc: started adding debugging
     output.  Set __DEBUG_LEVEL__ in CORBAmodule.h to enable (a 0 to 9 value).
   * CORBAmodule.cc: CORBA_Object_to_PyObject returns Py_None if the passed
     object is NULL rather than bailing out with an error.

   * CORBA_ORB.cc: fixed a stupid bug that caused a segfault with CVS ORBit, 
     and as a result created one more FIXME item. :)
   * Released 0.1.2

2000-03-13  Jason Tackaberry <tack@linux.com>

   * configure.in: forced precedence to g++ until I can fix the code to
     compile properly with Sun's Workshop.  (Okay, it still doesn't work
     properly.  I'm working on that.  Hack the Makefile to link in libgcc
     in the meantime.)

2000-03-13  Phil Dawes <philipd@users.sourceforge.net>

   * idl.cc: fixed a buglet that stops it from compiling with gcc-2.95
   * Added automake/autoconf support
   * Added a 'make check' test target to the src directory
   * Added an autogen.sh to generate the configure script and run it

2000-03-12  Jason Tackaberry <tack@linux.com>

   * PortableServermodule.[cc,h]: renamed to PortableServer.[cc,h] and the
     module is initialized from CORBAmodule.cc.  This will eliminate the
     shared library dependency problem between the two modules.
   * Fixed a cosmetic bug in test-client
   * Packaged this as version 0.1.1
   

2000-03-11  Jason Tackaberry <tack@linux.com>

   * initial version (0.1.0) released
